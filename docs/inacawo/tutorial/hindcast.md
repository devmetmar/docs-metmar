## Main differences from the forecast system

The forecast input data is available only near each forecast cycle time. Thus, the data must be downloaded and processed as soon as possible so that the forecast outputs are generated in a timely manner. To automate this process and ensure the results are delivered within the required time frame, the forecast system relies heavily on ROME tools. This suite of tools consists of complex driver scripts and watchdogs that manage each step of the workflow.

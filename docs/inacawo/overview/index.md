# Overview

BMKG previously operated independent atmospheric, wave, and ocean models, which limited the representation of cross-domain interactions in forecast outputs. To address this limitation, BMKG has implemented InaCAWO, a three-way coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean modeling system.

InaCAWO provides significantly higher spatial resolution and improved physical coupling between model components, enabling more accurate simulation of complex air-sea processes.

The system enhances forecast accuracy and spatial localization, supporting more reliable early warning and decision-making for severe weather and marine hazards.

InaCAWO Domain. <p>There are 70-vertical sigma layers in the ocean (ROMS) component, and 48 atmospheric WRF layers. Since the SWAN wave model is 2D in spectral-space, it's additional “layers” are defined by the spectral truncation needed to resolve wind-driven and swell-driven components at the 3km spatial scale.
